## ðŸš€ Project Overview  
Business App is a full-featured cross-platform mobile/web application built using Flutter that provides comprehensive business management tools. The application is designed primarily for small and medium production-based enterprises and includes three main modules:

1. **Business Growth** â€“ Track key production analytics: total working days, half-days, daily production, machine-wise output, waste, etc.  
2. **Worker Management** â€“ Manage worker attendance, salary withdrawals, production contribution, leaves, etc.  
3. **Stock Management & Billing** â€“ Manage inventory levels, cost & selling prices, dealer-wise billing, and generate client bills/invoices.

The app supports Android, iOS, Web and Desktop platforms.


## ðŸ“‚ Features  
- Responsive, adaptive UI using Material Design principles  
- Light/Dark theme switching  
- Real-time dashboard of production and worker statistics  
- Attendance tracking and salary module for workers  
- Stock inventory management including cost, margin and sales price  
- Dealer billing and invoice generation  
- Multi-platform (mobile, web, desktop) support via Flutter  
- Clean, modular architecture for maintainability and extensibility  


## ðŸ›  Getting Started  
### Prerequisites  
- [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) (version >= 3.0)  
- A suitable editor/IDE (Android Studio, VS Code, etc.)  
- Android/iOS emulator or real device, or a web browser for Flutter Web  

### Installation  
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Manavprajapati815/Business_App.git
cd Business_App

# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run the app
flutter run
````

For web deployment:

```bash
flutter run -d chrome
```

### Build for release

```bash
# Android (example)
flutter build apk --release

# Web
flutter build web
```

## ðŸ§© Architecture & Folder Structure

```
/lib/
  â”œâ”€ main.dart          # App entry point
  â”œâ”€ routes.dart        # Navigation/routes definitions
  â”œâ”€ screens/           # UI screens for each module
  â”œâ”€ widgets/           # Reusable custom widgets
  â”œâ”€ models/            # Data models/entities
  â”œâ”€ services/          # Business logic, APIs, local storage
  â””â”€ utils/             # Utility functions, constants, theme config
```

This modular structure helps maintain separation of concerns and makes the code base easier to scale and maintain.


## âœ… Why this is useful

* Helps businesses consolidate production, workforce and stock data into a single unified application.
* Provides data-driven insights and helps management make better decisions.
* Built with Flutter: a single code base supports multiple platforms (Android, iOS, Web, Desktop).
* Designed with scalability in mind: you can extend modules or integrate additional features (e.g., reporting, analytics, multi-user roles) with ease.


## ðŸ§ª Testing

* Automated tests (unit/integration) can be added under the `/test` directory.
* To run tests:

```bash
flutter test
```


## ðŸ’¡ Future Enhancements

* Multi-user login and role-based access (admin/manager/worker)
* Cloud backend integration (e.g., Firebase, REST API)
* Real-time sync and offline support
* Export reports to PDF/Excel formats
* Graphical visualisations (charts, heatmaps) of production and workforce data
